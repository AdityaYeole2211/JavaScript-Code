    //setTimeout -> 
    /*The global setTimeout() method sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece
    of code once the timer expires.
    setTimeout() is an asynchronous function, meaning that the timer function will 
    not pause execution of other functions in the functions stack. In other words, 
    you cannot use setTimeout() to create a "pause" before the next function in the function stack 
    fires.
    hen you pass a method to setTimeout(), it will be invoked with a this value that may differ from your expectation. The general issue is explained in detail in the JavaScript reference.

    Code executed by setTimeout() is called from an execution context separate from the function from 
    which setTimeout was called. The usual rules for setting the this keyword for the called 
    function apply, and if you have not set this in the call or with bind, it will default to the 
    window (or global) object, even in strict mode. It will not be the same as the this value for
    the function that called setTimeout.
    The returned timeoutID is a positive integer value which identifies the timer created by the call to setTimeout(). This value can be passed to clearTimeout() to cancel the timeout.

    It is guaranteed that a timeoutID value will never be reused by a subsequent call to setTimeout() 
    or setInterval() on the same object (a window or a worker) while the timer is still active. 
    However, different objects use separate pools of IDs.

    //NOTE THAT SET TIMEOUT IS NOT JAVASCRIPT FUNCTION THEY ARE NOT PART OF THE USUAL STACK AND HEAP FUCNTIONS 
    //THEY ARE EXCUTED VIA API CALLS AND THEN ADDED BACK TO TASK QUEUE

   /* setTimeout(function(){
        console.log("hello world")
    }, 2000)*/
    //can also give function reference , DONT EXECUTE 
    const sayHello = function(){
        console.log("hello world")
    }
    //setTimeout(sayHello, 2000)
    const changeText = function(){
        document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML = "JavaScript is Web-dev"
    }
    //setTimeout(changeText, 2000)

    //clear Timeout  -> used to stop setTmeout under certain circumstances
    //need to  give referecne of which timeout to stop
    const changeMe = setTimeout(changeText, 2000)

    document.querySelector('#stop').addEventListener('click', function(){
        clearTimeout(changeMe)
        console.log("stopped")
    })

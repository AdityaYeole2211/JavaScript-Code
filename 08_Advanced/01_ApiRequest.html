    //What is API?
    /*
    An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows different computer programs to communicate with each other. APIs are a type of software interface that acts as a messenger, taking requests from one program and sending responses back to it.
    */
    /*NowAdays , api work done through fetch. But earlier , API work was done throrugh 
    AJAX programming. Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax, or AJAX) is a web development technique in which a web app fetches content from the server by making asynchronous HTTP requests, and uses the new content to update the relevant parts of the page without requiring a full page load. This can make the page more responsive, because only the parts that need to be updated are requested.

    Ajax can be used to create single-page apps, in which the entire web app consists of a single document, which uses Ajax to update its content as needed
    Initially Ajax was implemented using the XMLHttpRequest interface, but the fetch() API is more suitable for modern web applications: it is more powerful, more flexible, and integrates better with fundamental web app technologies such as service workers. Modern web frameworks also provide abstractions for Ajax.*/$

    /*XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing. Despite its name, XMLHttpRequest can be used to retrieve any type of data, not just XML. The XMLHttpRequest.readyState property returns the state an XMLHttpRequest client is in. An XHR client exists in one of the following states:

    Value	State	Description
    0	UNSENT	            Client has been created. open() not called yet.
    1	OPENED	            open() has been called.
    2	HEADERS_RECEIVED	send() has been called, and headers and status are                     available.
    3	LOADING	            Downloading; responseText holds partial data.
    4	DONE	            The operation is complete.

    
    UNSENT
    The XMLHttpRequest client has been created, but the open() method hasn't been called yet.

    OPENED
    open() method has been invoked. During this state, the request headers can be set using the setRequestHeader() method and the send() method can be called which will initiate the fetch.

    HEADERS_RECEIVED
    send() has been called, all redirects (if any) have been followed and the response headers have been received.

    LOADING
    Response's body is being received. If responseType is "text" or empty string, responseText will have the partial text response as it loads.

    DONE
    The fetch operation is complete. This could mean that either the data transfer has been completed successfully or failed.
